This is the [Skrub](https://skrub-data.org/stable/) learning materials website: 
this is where you'll be able to find all the material that is used to teach and 
present Skrub to audiences. 

Slides for presentations, talks and lectures are in 
[slides section](slides/index_slides.qmd).
Notebooks and blog posts are instead located in the 
[notebook section](notebooks/index_notebooks.qmd).

Note that the material that is gathered here may become obsolete depending on 
the development of Skrub.

For up-to-date information on Skrub and its API refer to the 
[documentation](https://skrub-data.org/stable/reference/index.html), while  
additional examples are available in the 
[main gallery](https://skrub-data.org/stable/auto_examples/index.html). 
Material on the main website is constantly tested with the latest version of Skrub.
